Attributes
----------

There are lots of attributes available in each of the dependant cookbooks - we're not overriding any of them in this cookbook.

If you're building on Vagrant, please view the note below.

Recipes
-------

### octohost::default

Builds the [octohost](https://www.octohost.io) server using Chef.

To get started with this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/octohost/octohost-cookbook.git
cd octohost-cookbook
bundle install
berks install
```

Then you should be able to build any of the images.

### Packer Build

In order to build an Amazon AMI, DigitalOcean Droplet or Rackspace OpenStack image, you will need accounts for each. Export these values to get Packer to honor them automatically:

    # Rackspace
    export SDK_USERNAME="username"  # Same as here: https://mycloud.rackspace.com/
    export SDK_PASSWORD="password-to-login" # Not the API key.
    export SDK_PROVIDER="rackspace-us" # Or rackspace-uk

    # EC2 - can be found here: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials?
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY="long-random-string"
    export AWS_SECRET_KEY="another-even-longer-long-random-string"

    # Digital Ocean - get these here: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications
    export DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN="long-random-string"

You may have to use a different source image for Rackspace - Rackspace doesn't allow you to share them.

I built my source image from [this related repo](https://github.com/octohost/ubuntu-14.04).

### Vagrant Build

An already created Vagrant box is available at [here](https://github.com/octohost/octovagrant) - if you want to build your own read on.

Before you build the Vagrant box with `rake build_vagrant` - please update these attributes:

    default['vagrant']['keys'] = 'https://raw.github.com/nonfiction/keys/master/keys'
    default['git']['keys'] = 'https://raw.github.com/nonfiction/keys/master/gitreceive-keys'

The wildcard domain record *.octodev.io will work for anyone at 192.168.62.86. An octohost is much more useful when your own keys are installed. Even though we can't get to your non-routable 192.168.62.86 address, please don't install our keys on your server.

Once it's built and has your keys in it - package it up:

    vagrant package default --output ~/Desktop/octohost.box
    vagrant box add octohost ~/Desktop/octohost.box
    vagrant init octohost

Add this line to the Vagrantfile:

    config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.62.86"

Then:

    vagrant up
    git clone git@github.com:octohost/harp.git && cd harp
    git remote add octo git@serve.octodev.io:harp.git
    git push octo master
    lynx http://harp.octodev.io

You know have your own local, private octohost for development and testing - with a free wildcard dns record.

You're welcome.

#### Testing

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/octohost/octohost-cookbook.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/octohost/octohost-cookbook)

The cookbook provides the following Rake tasks for testing:

    rake build                        # Syntax check and build all Packer targets
    rake build_ami                    # Syntax check and build AMI
    rake build_droplet                # Syntax check and build Droplet
    rake build_gce                    # Syntax check and build Google Compute Image
    rake build_openstack              # Syntax check and build Openstack Image
    rake build_vagrant                # Syntax check and build Vagrant box
    rake cleanup_vendor               # Cleanup Vendor directory
    rake food_extra                   # Run extra Foodcritic rulesets
    rake integration                  # Alias for kitchen:all
    rake kitchen:all                  # Run all test instances
    rake kitchen:default-ubuntu-1204  # Run default-ubuntu-1204 test instance
    rake kitchen:default-ubuntu-1404  # Run default-ubuntu-1404 test instance
    rake knife_solo                   # Usage: rake knife_solo user={user} ip={ip.address.goes.here}
    rake lint                         # Lint Chef cookbooks
    rake rubocop                      # Run rubocop tests
    rake spec                         # Run ChefSpec examples
    rake tailor                       # Run tailor tests
    rake taste                        # Run taste tests
